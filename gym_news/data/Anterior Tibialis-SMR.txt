Anterior Tibialis-SMR
Begin seated on the ground with your legs bent and your feet on the floor. 
Using a Muscle Roller or a rolling pin, apply pressure to the muscles on the outside of your shins. Work from just below the knee to above the ankle, pausing at points of tension for 10-30 seconds. Repeat on the other leg.
