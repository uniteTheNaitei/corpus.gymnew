Drop Push
Position low boxes or other platforms 2-3 feet apart.
 Move to a pushup position between them, supporting yourself by placing your hands on the boxes.
 With good posture, drop from the platforms by pressing up and moving your hands to shoulder width, cushioning your landing by absorbing the impact through the arm.
