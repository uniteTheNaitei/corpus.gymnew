Seated Palms-Down Barbell Wrist Curl
 Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing down; hands spaced about shoulder width.
 Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
 Lean forward and place your forearms on top of your upper thighs with your palms down. 
 Make sure that the back of the wrists lay on top of your knees.  This will be your starting position.
 Lower the bar as far as possible while inhaling and keeping a tight grip.
 Now curl bar up as high as possible while flexing the forearms and exhaling.  Hold the contraction at the top for a second and 
 Only the wrist should move.
