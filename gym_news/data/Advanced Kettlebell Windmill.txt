Advanced Kettlebell Windmill
 Clean and press a kettlebell overhead with one arm.
 Keeping the kettlebell locked out at all times, push your butt out in the direction of the locked out kettlebell. Keep the non-working arm behind your back and turn your feet out at a forty-five degree angle from the arm with the kettlebell.
 Lower yourself as far as possible.
 Pause for a second and reverse the motion back to the starting position.
