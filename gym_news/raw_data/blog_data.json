I usually follow along FB burn or Fb 30-type upper body vids (around 30 mins), and sometimes make up my own program for the day (around 30-40 min). Either I choose pure strength training, or a combination of strength and cardio (like kickboxing), and I focus on this muscle group twice a week. I am a 33 year old female and have never been strong in the upper body, but I've been doing FB workours for almost 4 years now, and although I've seen tremendous improvements in all other areas, my upper body doesn't seem to progress past the first \"plateau\" I've reached (like.. 3 years back!). Also, and maybe because of that, I find it hard to motivate myself to doing upper body workouts. I know I enjoy most the alternating and descending rep ones, but there aren't that many.

That made my weekends rest / recovery wkout days which was perfect for me.  Last week was Thanksgiving.  I took the day off and then, for the long weekend, I went snowboarding (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).  I came home, took Monday off and jumped back in again on Tuesday.  I had no trouble rescheduling my \"missed\" Burn workouts by pushing them forward.    Tomorrow will be Thursday, however, and my calendar wants me in a recovery workout, followed by a rest day on Friday and back to full throttle on Saturday.  I want to go full throttle for Thursday and Friday and rest/recover over the weekend but I just can't figure a way to swap the rest days with the workouts I want to do.  Am I missing something? Is there a trick to it?  Or must I forever calculate where I left off and sub things out mentally?  I get up at the crack of dawn to workout precisely because I like to force myself into exercise before my brain is fully awake and aware of what I'm doing LOL!

I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs.

I actually started with FB free workout videos since the beginning of September and also ate healthier - although I wasn't exercising as regularly as I am now. It's been almost a month now since I started the program, but, physically, I don't see much change - just some slight muscle definition on my arms but very very little - which I find disappointing. My goal was to look slimmer (arms, legs, stomach) and I don't care about the weight; but I did notice that I gained weight (3 pounds)! I guess it's from the muscles? And that my stomach became bigger?! I do feel stronger though. I'm just worried that I won't see any difference physically by the end of the program.", "img": null, "comment": []}

My dad passed away due to heart condition he had for several years. He was overweight - bordering obesity for most of his life, and i'm quite certain that that had contributed to his heart disease. Well, that and heredity. See, it's all in my heredity. The overweightedness, heart disease, diabetes..all the bad things. Everyone grieves in their own way, and i have slowly started to feel better, and that has made me determined to start working out again, and be healthy. I constantly think about working out, but i just can't get myself to start. The image of me working out again is there in my head, but i just don't have the motivation to start.

I guess I could also do some Fitness Blender on running days, but I don't want to overdo it. However, I am hoping to lose weight both for my general health and to improve my running times. Is anyone else here combining running training with Fitness Blender workouts, and how do you combine the two?", "img": null, "comment": []}

I am very careful about keeping my back straight because I know that could be a cause of lower back pain during deadlifts, so that is definitely not the case. I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs.

I now keep up and smash them! I workout 6 days a week and every morning I get excited to pick the workout! My kids (4 and 2) come over and star jump and squat with me so I'm glad they're watching me become healthy rather than binge eating and feeling depressed, and they find it hilarious when I plank to tickle me... I do not find that as funny as them haha! Inches lost: stomach/ hips 8 inches.... thighs: 4 1/2 inches....arms: 1 1/2 inches :) Hope everyone smashes their workouts for this week and has a great weekend xox", "img": "https://www.fitnessblender.com/userassets/discussion/452.JPG", "comment": []}

After losing my father in September, i noticed how the grief was consuming me. I was angry at every thing and every one, i was extremely non productive at work, and would just feel ..empty. My dad passed away due to heart condition he had for several years. He was overweight - bordering obesity for most of his life, and i'm quite certain that that had contributed to his heart disease. Well, that and heredity. See, it's all in my heredity. The overweightedness, heart disease, diabetes..all the bad things. Everyone grieves in their own way, and i have slowly started to feel better, and that has made me determined to start working out again, and be healthy. I constantly think about working out, but i just can't get myself to start. The image of me working out again is there in my head, but i just don't have the motivation to start.

I'm confused about when to to upper/lower section days, along with when to do core and total. Do you mix them all up or just focus one section a day or what? Here is my schedule and please, I am open to input. Saturday: 3 Day Flexibility Challenge Day 1: Fluid Full Body Stretches for Flexibility & Stress Relief. Sunday:3 Day Flexibility Challenge Day 2: Pilates Yoga Blend for Flexibility and Toning. Monday:No Equipment Upper Body and Cardio Kickboxing Workout. Tuesday:Abs and Lower Body Pilates Workout for Beginners. Wednesday: Low Impact Cardio and Abs Workout with Warm Up and Cool Down. Thursday: Best Butt Workout to Build a Booty and Tone Thighs - Butt & Thigh Workout. Friday:No Equipment Upper Body and Cardio Kickboxing Workout.  Is this too much too fast? Or good enough for a beginner? Also, I want to try and eat whole foods and maybe use less of things like condiments, sugar, etc. I want to tighten up, not lose weight because I am not overweight, but my stomach is getting bigger and I'd like to tone my arms too.

I am very careful about keeping my back straight because I know that could be a cause of lower back pain during deadlifts, so that is definitely not the case. I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs. Is there anyone who had any similar issue and managed to resolve it? Current goals are fat loss rather than toning or building muscle, so I might consider stopping deadlifts altogether at this point.

My training plan that I made involves only 2 Fitness Blender workouts per week, to allow for a rest day and 3 - 4 running days. I guess I could also do some Fitness Blender on running days, but I don't want to overdo it. However, I am hoping to lose weight both for my general health and to improve my running times.

However, after starting a new and extremely demanding job  my workouts started decreasing from 5 to 3 times a week. My father got really sick around the same time, and that together with my new job didn't leave any time for me to work out, and they stopped altogether. After losing my father in September, i noticed how the grief was consuming me. I was angry at every thing and every one, i was extremely non productive at work, and would just feel ..empty. My dad passed away due to heart condition he had for several years. He was overweight - bordering obesity for most of his life, and i'm quite certain that that had contributed to his heart disease. Well, that and heredity. See, it's all in my heredity. The overweightedness, heart disease, diabetes..all the bad things. Everyone grieves in their own way, and i have slowly started to feel better, and that has made me determined to start working out again, and be healthy. I constantly think about working out, but i just can't get myself to start. The image of me working out again is there in my head, but i just don't have the motivation to start. Also, the only time i would have to work out, would be in the morning, at around 6am, which is a whole other battle on its own.", "img": null, "comment": []}

Also, and maybe because of that, I find it hard to motivate myself to doing upper body workouts. I know I enjoy most the alternating and descending rep ones, but there aren't that many.

I now keep up and smash them! I workout 6 days a week and every morning I get excited to pick the workout! My kids (4 and 2) come over and star jump and squat with me so I'm glad they're watching me become healthy rather than binge eating and feeling depressed, and they find it hilarious when I plank to tickle me... I do not find that as funny as them haha! Inches lost: stomach/ hips 8 inches.... thighs: 4 1/2 inches....arms: 1 1/2 inches :) Hope everyone smashes their workouts for this week and has a great weekend xox", "img": "https://www.fitnessblender.com/userassets/discussion/452.JPG", "comment": []}

I guess I could also do some Fitness Blender on running days, but I don't want to overdo it. However, I am hoping to lose weight both for my general health and to improve my running times.

However, after starting a new and extremely demanding job  my workouts started decreasing from 5 to 3 times a week. My father got really sick around the same time, and that together with my new job didn't leave any time for me to work out, and they stopped altogether. After losing my father in September, i noticed how the grief was consuming me. I was angry at every thing and every one, i was extremely non productive at work, and would just feel ..empty. My dad passed away due to heart condition he had for several years. He was overweight - bordering obesity for most of his life, and i'm quite certain that that had contributed to his heart disease. Well, that and heredity. See, it's all in my heredity. The overweightedness, heart disease, diabetes..all the bad things. Everyone grieves in their own way, and i have slowly started to feel better, and that has made me determined to start working out again, and be healthy. I constantly think about working out, but i just can't get myself to start. The image of me working out again is there in my head, but i just don't have the motivation to start.

I am very careful about keeping my back straight because I know that could be a cause of lower back pain during deadlifts, so that is definitely not the case. I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs. Is there anyone who had any similar issue and managed to resolve it? Current goals are fat loss rather than toning or building muscle, so I might consider stopping deadlifts altogether at this point.

Now, i am 5'7 and pretty fit, i play soccer and do these videos in my off season. Although, i need to ask about tips. What should i do to stop the pounds from packing up?? I have gone from 119 to 125 in just a few weeks because of my \"bed rest\". I can't do anything without a headache or getting out of breath or fainting, so how can i keep healthy? please anything helps.

I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs.

I am very careful about keeping my back straight because I know that could be a cause of lower back pain during deadlifts, so that is definitely not the case. I thought maybe I'm lifting weights which are too heavy, but to be honest, my legs don't get tired or sore at all with the current weights so if I lower the weight any further, I'm afraid the exercise will be ineffective for the legs. Is there anyone who had any similar issue and managed to resolve it? Current goals are fat loss rather than toning or building muscle, so I might consider stopping deadlifts altogether at this point.
